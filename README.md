# Hi there 👋

I'm Idrissa Diallo and I'm better known under the pseudonym of Black Fury. <br>

I'm a Junior Frontend Developer passionate about building beautiful and intuitive user interfaces. I have experience with HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and React, and I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills. <br>

My first project as a Frontend Developer was to build <a href="https://blackfury117.github.io/" target="_blank">my personal website</a>, where I practiced all my knowledge to make it. <br>

I'm excited to continue building projects and contributing to open-source software.
